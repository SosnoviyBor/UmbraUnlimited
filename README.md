# Umbra Unlimited (OpenMW)

Brings the Umbra Sword up to its legendary name - now it will inflict Soul Trap with every hit, regardless of its enchantment or charge.

> The Umbra Sword was enchanted by the ancient witch Naenra Waerr, and its sole purpose was the entrapment of souls. Used in conjunction with a soul gem, the Sword allows the wielder the opportunity to imprison an enemy's soul in the gem. Naenra was executed for her evil creation, but not before she was able to hide the Sword. The Umbra Sword is very choosy when it comes to owners and therefore remains hidden until a worthy one is found.  
> _— Tamrielic Lore_

## What?

Now the Umbra Sword will inflict its victim with a Soul Trap spell on each hit, regardless of its enchantment or charge.

It's probably for the best, but the spell won't have any VFX or SFX on hit - only on enemy's death.

## Why?

1. Weapons with On Use enchantments are stinky.
2. Five total spell casts? For a legendary artifact? That's more fake than a `* Sunder *`. Todd, come on — I can enchant a better item with a Scamp's soul.

## And that's all?

No. For flavor, there are a few additional plugins that edit Umbra's actual enchantment:

1. **Umbra Unenchanted**
2. **Umbra Skyrimized**
   - Absorb Health 25 pts for 1 sec
   - Absorb Fatigue 25 pts for 1 sec
   - 288 charge / 21 cost = 13 uses

## Compatibility

Completely safe to install, update, or remove mid-playthrough.

Compatible with any mod that edits Umbra or Umbra Sword - the script relies purely on sword's ID.
